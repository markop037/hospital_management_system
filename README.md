## Introduction

This hospital management application is developed in Java, using JavaFX for the graphical interface. The application allows for viewing and managing data on doctors, patients, appointments, expenses, 
and medical records. The data is stored in a database, and the application uses JDBC for connectivity. It enables adding new patients, scheduling appointments, tracking expenses, and maintaining medical records.
