## Introduction

This hospital management application is developed in Java, using JavaFX for the graphical interface. The application allows for viewing and managing data on doctors, patients, appointments, expenses, 
and medical records. The data is stored in a database, and the application uses JDBC for connectivity. It enables adding new patients, scheduling appointments, tracking expenses, and maintaining medical records.

## Technologies and Tools

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **JavaFX**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: A technology for connecting the Java application with a relational database, allowing data manipulation and execution of SQL queries.
- **MySQL**: The relational database used for storing information about patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records.
- **XAMPP**: A software package used for locally hosting the MySQL database and managing it.
